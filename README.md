## Introduction
BlockChase est un mode de jeu revisité du mini-jeu "BlockHunt" ou "Prophunt", qui sont eux même une version revisité du mode de jeu "Hide and seek"".
Ce mode de jeu permet au joueur de ce transformer en bloc afin de se cacher des chercheurs. This plugin allows you to do that but with a lot more features added on such as: shops, stats etc...

>**_Disclaimer_**
> This plugin uses an auto update system, which means it will check for updates (this feature is perhaps broken at the moment). To disable this go to the config file and disable the auto-update feature. This plugin uses a Metrics system made by Hidendra, which means some information will be sent to MCStats.org and shown to the public. This data includes information such as the plugin's version, server versions, OS systems, Java version, etc. All data is sent to MCStats.org for analysis either by the public or plugin author. No personal data is taken from the server and if you want to opt-out of MCStats, go to your plugins folder, then go to the "PluginMetrics" folder (This folder is automatically created) and then set "opt-out" to true. More info can be found on MCStats.org. With this information, we can see how many people are using the current version of the plugin and its popularity so we know when to push for further updates.
